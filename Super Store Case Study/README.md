## Business Problem

A US retail superstore generated $2.30M in sales across 2014–2017, with revenue growing from $484K to $733K. But underneath the growth, profit margin sits at just 12.5% and is being actively eroded by aggressive discounting, loss-making product sub-categories, and geographic markets where the business is selling at a loss. The business is growing revenue while undermining the profitability of that growth.

## Key Findings

- **Discounts above 30% generate negative profit margins** — orders with 51%+ discounts produce a -119.20% margin, meaning the business spends $2.19 to generate $1 of revenue on those transactions
- **Tables is an accelerating loss** — losses nearly tripled from ($3K) in 2014 to ($8K) in 2017; removing Tables and Bookcases would have added $9K to 2017 profit
- **Technology delivers 17.4% margin vs Furniture at 2.5%** — the product mix is working against profitability
- **Texas is the third largest state by sales but loses ($25.7K)** — five states are loss-making at scale despite significant sales volume
- **Machines: $189K in sales at 1.8% margin** — high revenue sub-category consuming operational resource for near-zero return
